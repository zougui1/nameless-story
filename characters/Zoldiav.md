## Past

A group of anthros stole Zoldiav's egg, among others, before he hatched. They wanted to have dragon eggs to have them hatch under their control so they could brainwash them to serve their cause. One day, not long after Zoldiav had hatched, some of the anthros from the group were on a mission to steal more eggs. While they were gone, some feral dragons attacked the anthros who stayed to take care of the eggs and hatchlings. The dragons rescued all the eggs and hatchlings. But unfortunately, Zoldiav has never known his parents, he doesn't even know their names! He didn't know anyone who might know who his parents are. And that goes for all of the other eggs and hatchlings. They were all being cared for by the dragons who rescued them.
Zoldiav hopes that one day he would find out something about his parents, perhaps even meet them.

## Notes

Zoldiav would like to have a few anthro slaves.

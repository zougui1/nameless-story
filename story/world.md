## Feral Dragons

- lifespan: 800 to 1000 years
- clutch size: 4 to 9 eggs

Dragons often have scales and a thick hide. However, although it is rare, some can have a thin hide.
Most dragons can use magic, but some are unable to.

(NSFW)
Dragons don't care about privacy. They may or may not go somewhere "private" to have sex but they don't care if anyone hears or is watching them.

### Clans

There are 3 clans of dragons. None of these clans are anything "official". They're all implicit.
Anyone who is against anthros is said to be a supremacist.
Anyone who is with anthros is said to be a pacifist.
Anyone who doesn't care is said to be neutral.
Dragons, no matter the clan, may live alone just like they may live in groups.

#### Pacifists

They are dragons who want to coexist with anthros.

#### Supremacists

They are dragons who don't want to coexist with dragons. They may have different reasons. Some may wish to exterminate anthros, enslave them, they just think they are far superior and anthros don't deserve to lay their eyes upon them, etc...

#### Neutrals

They just want to live their life. They don't care about anthros, pacifists or supremacists.

### Furred/maned feral dragons

Furred and maned feral dragons originally don't exist. They will eventually appear as hybrids between furred anthros and feral dragons.
The supremacists won't consider furred/maned dragons to actually be dragons. They will see them as lesser beings, as nothing more than the anthros.

## Anthros

Anthros can be of any species.
Anthros can (although not easily) kill dragons with a thin hide. They are able to harm dragons with a thick hide but they can't kill them. The only ways they could hurt dragons with scales were to hit their eyes, their ears and their wings. They could blind them and deafen them.

(NSFW)
Anthros value privacy during intimate moments. They generally don't want anyone to see or hear them having sex (excluding kinks).

### Anthro dragons

Anthro dragons are rare as they are hybrids between feral dragons and anthros of any species.
They are very strong, not as much as feral dragons but not too far off.
Their magic is generally weak, about as harmful as arrows. Although that may soon change... However, they can use their magic to escape dragons.

## History

The origin of the war is lost to time. Someone at some point will learn of its origin by reading an old book or something.
But in the present, the war is simply an endless cycle of violence, anger, revenge and more violence.

## Ideas

- There are groups of anthros stealing feral dragon eggs to have them hatch under their control and influence so they could brainwash them to serve their cause, making them believe the supremacist dragons are wrong and the anthros and pacifist dragons are right.
- Maybe every pacifist feral dragons originate from dragons that were brainwashed by anthros.

## Past

5 years old

When he was still young, a small group of anthro dragons attacked his group while they were sleeping. Before anyone could fight back they took the children hostages to keep the adults from fighting back, while they tortured the adults until they eventually killed them. Making the children watch all of it, forcing them to watch as their parents and friends were tortured and slowly, painfully died. Utterly powerless as their children were held hostages by these sickly anthro dragons. Once the anthro dragons were done killing the last one of the adults they started torturing the children. Before the anthro dragons killed all the children, a group of supremacist dragons came to rescue them, but by then only two of them were still alive, both of them were injured. A few days later one of them died from her injuries, Elrodin's sister.
That day, Elrodin's hatred for anthro dragons grew to such extents he vowed to kill every single one of them.

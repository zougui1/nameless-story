## Past

His mother was raped and enslaved (as a sex slave) by a hellhound. Later on she laid multiple eggs that were all corrupted by the seed of the demonic beast. But only one of them hatched, Nalvados' egg (Which would explain why he's part demon).
After a few years, they tried to escape but the hellhound noticed them trying to escape. His mother gave her life to give him the possibility to escape. He eventually found a group of supremacists that eventually found out about a hellhound that was summoned by anthros to try and help them fight supremacist dragons. After learning that, while Nalvados hated demons more than anything, he grew a profound hatred for anthros.

### Details

His mother was raped by the hellhound everyday. Every time that happened she was left with bruises, blood dripping from wounds left by the demonic beast's claws and teeth. It was rough with, very rough. Not one day went by without her being used by the demon. It's like it was relentless, its lust insatiable. Her wounds from the previous rounds didn't even have time to fully heal that it would not only reopen her wounds but also give her new wounds. As a result, she was weak. The first few months after the beast abducted her, where she still had the strength to struggle, she couldn't escape. The cave they were in was small and there was no barrier whatsoever to keep her from getting away. But every time she tried, it was like the demon knew it, sensed it somehow. She didn't even go far away from the cave that the beast had already found her and fucked her more roughly that it usually did. After only a couple of attempts she gave up, she gave up hope that she would one day escape this hell.
Eventually she laid eggs. The eggs may have been coming out of her, but she strongly believed that those eggs were not that of a dragon. They were demons. The hellhound's spawn. She wanted to destroy them. When she looked at those eggs, eggs were not what she saw. All she saw was demons. Pain. Suffering. She didn't want this world to have more of this hell beast. One was more than enough already. She tried to destroy them, but every time she was about to, an unknown force kept her from doing so. She hated those eggs almost as much as the demon that fertilized them. And yet. She could not bring herself to destroy them, her instincts prevented her from doing so.
Eventually, one of the eggs hatched. She watched the egg move and crack with horror. She was terrified that more of this demonic beast would populate the world and cause more suffering. And in her heart she knew it would be her fault. However, what hatched wasn't a hellhound, it wasn't a demon, even though it had some features resembling that of a demon, it looked like a dragon. For the first time in what felt to her like an eternity, she had hope. She had hope that she sired not a demon but a dragon. Even though she didn't have the strength to escape anymore, she knew she couldn't stay here, not with a hatchling. She had to escape, not for her, but for her dragon hatchling. When the time was right, when she would get the opportunity she would escape, or try to.
In the meantime, the hellhound kept using her, violating her body and breaking it more and more with its rough breeding sessions. And since they lived in a small cave. Everything that happened, happened in front of the hatchling, in front of Nalvados. While Nalvados didn't understand what was happening at the time, one day he would.
One day, when the beast was away, hunting for food. The dragoness made her move and fled the cave with her Nalvados. However, just like when she tried at the beginning, the beast sensed it and before she realized it had already found them. But this time it was fine, she expected this to happen, she didn't believe she would escape she had already prepared herself to die. The reason she escaped today and not any of the previous day was a simple one. She caught a scent. Dragons weren't far from their current position. All she had to do was fight the demon that raped her for years in the hope that her hatchling would escape with the other dragons and live the happy life that was stolen from her. She purposefully roared as loud as she could at the beast, if she roared loud enough maybe the other dragons would hear it and maybe, just maybe they will find Nalvados and take him under their care. She was weaken from all the rough sex she has endured for years, she didn't know if she could even fight. When the demon came at her she tried to dodge, but all of her body was hurting, she could move, but not fast enough to dodge the incoming attack and the demon hit her on the with its claws. She fell to the ground, the fight was over before it even started. She tilted her head to look at her hatchling one last time, a tear coming down her cheek. She was about to die, but in that moment she smiled, she was happy, the other dragons she smelled were taking her hatchling away from here, away from that hell beast. In that instant, the beast finished her off.

#### Notes

It is incomplete and is missing:
- a reason as to why the hellhound did not destroy the eggs nor killed the hatched dragon
- how the dragoness survived: the demon fed her enough so she would stay alive for him to use her more
- why the other eggs did not hatch
- what happened after he was rescued: they went back to where his mother died and brung her back with them, she had cuts and bite marks everywhere and he holes were gaping and dripping of the beast's unholy seed

## Notes

Nalvados is a firm believer that feral dragons are the best beings in the world and should never lower themselves for beings of other species. That anthros deserve nothing, not even breathe the same air as dragons.

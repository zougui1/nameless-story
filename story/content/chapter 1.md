Zoldiav had just finished working for the day and retired to a cave. He usually lived with a group of dragons. But not today. Today he lived with only one other dragon, Nalvados. Whom he could already see in the cave as he approached. And that got him angry... 'How could he be so careless as to stay at the entrance of the cave?? Anyone who might be around could see him!' he thought to himself. When he arrived at the cave he greeted his rival with a tackle. Nalvados, caught by surprised, did not have time to react and he fell over. Zoldiav used that opportunity to wrap his tail around Nalvados' neck, loosely enough that he won't choke, and dragged him further into the cave.

"Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?!" Nalvados shouted accompanied with a roar as he struggled trying to get free but Zoldiav tightened his grip on his neck.

"Shut up! If there is an enemy around they will know we're here! And you were staying at the entrance of the cave? You better hope no one saw you!"

As they were deep enough in the cave, where no one could see them, he released Nalvados' neck. Nalvados immediately got up onto all fours and gave Zoldiav a threatening stare while snarling. "That does not give you the right to tackle me and coil your tail around my neck, you could have choked me!" He was ready to attack, just waiting, gauging the dragon in front of him.

"Oh yeah? Because maybe you have the right to get us all killed by staying at the entrance of the cave? Because if an enemy saw you we will be in trouble!" said Zoldiav while on the defensive, prepare to counter any incoming attack if need be.

Nalvados was annoyed by his remarks. He was right, he knew he was right. But he would never admit it, he was far too proud for that. So instead he emitted a faint growl and he stood up onto his hind paws. Zoldiav, seeing as the dragon in front of him took an aggressive stance, knew Nalvados was about to attack him so he immediately took the same stance and he was about to prepare himself to block any incoming attack but Nalvados was too quick he hit him on the muzzle with a front paw. Were an enemy in front of him he would have used his claws and all his strength to attack, but as annoying as Zoldiav could be, he remained his friend, or more correctly, his rival. Nalvados didn't use his claws, but he still stroke him with force, not enough to injure him, but just enough to hurt. 'Fuck that hurts. Damn him.. How dares he hit me? And on the muzzle at that!' Zoldiav thought, clearly pissed off as he started growling before turning into a snarl. Zoldiav lowers his front end and jumps forth onto Nalvados. Nalvados gasped in surprise. He gave out a pained moan as his back hits the ground, he was pinned down by Zoldiav and he bit down on his neck, his teeth didn't sink deep, there wasn't even a single drop of blood leaking, but he was sure the dragon underneath him would be marked for a while, a painful reminder never to piss him off. Although he wasn't bleeding, that bite still stung, it was painful and only made him more angry than he previously was and he made it known with a loud roar.

Elrodin was walking towards a cave, although he couldn't see its entrance as it was hidden well enough by trees and bushes, he knew where it was. As he was walking, a sudden roar could be heard, that roar seemed to be coming from the direction the cave was located at. 'Fuck, did they find us already?!' Elrodin thought to himself as he started running, afraid for his teammates. Fortunately he wasn't far away from the cave and soon he could see the entrance and he stepped in, still running until he reached the source of that roar. That's when he saw it. That absurd show. His teammates were fighting one another! Getting angrier by the second he shouted "You morons!" He tackled Zoldiav and hit Nalvados' snout with his tail. Zoldiav, loosing his grip on Nalvados' neck by the tackle he was sent flying back. He landed on the ground onto his back and let out a pained groan. "Do you have any idea of what you've done?? I wasn't even next to the cave entrance that I heard you roar! It took us a while to find this cave perfect for us to set camp in our enemy's territory and now you two just blew it! If I heard that roar then who knows who else might have heard it. We're in ENEMY territory for fuck's sake!! We've been sent here on a mission and after only one day you're already putting it at risk!"
The rivals said nothing, instead they both let out an ashamed whimper. Upon hearing their whimper, Elrodin sighed. "Let's go, we have to leave. It's too dangerous to stay here any longer."

The two rivals got up on all fours, although Zoldiav gave a low groan in pain, that tackle got him good. Then the three of them made their way towards the entrance of the cave. "We better get ourselves covered in mud to cover our scent. If there are canines or dragons around they would be able to follow our scent. There is a river nearby, there's probably mud around it." When they were outside the cave Elrodin immediately walked towards where he saw a river and the other two followed him. They had walked for less than a minute and already they could see the river Elrodin spoke of and, just like he thought, there was mud all around a part of that river. "Alright, let's cover ourselves in mud." Elrodin laid on his back and rolled around in the mud. In just a matter of seconds his entire back was covered in mud, so he sprawled on his belly to get that part covered. He then sat down and used a paw to cover his snout as well. Every inch of his body was covered in mud. Nalvados and Zoldiav watched Elrodin covering himself in mud, not really wanting to do the same as that looked pretty gross. "If I'm the only one covered in mud that won't do any good. So get started." Zoldiav and Nalvados stared at one another, waiting for the other to start doing it. "NOW!" Elrodin shouted, and with that, the other two got started and did exactly what Elrodin previously did. At the exception of Zoldiav, who did one thing differently. He did everything to avoid covering the part between his legs covered in mud. But that did not go unnoticed by Elrodin who was watching them, making sure they both fully covered themselves in mud. If any part of their body was free of mud their scent would not be completely covered and well trained canines and dragons could still track them. "Zoldiav, your slit must be covered in mud too. Especially yours. You get pretty musky at times."

Zoldiav jerked his snout towards Elrodin "W-what? No! That's disgusting. I won't do it."

With a sigh Elrodin approached Zoldiav "Fine. If you won't do it then I'll do it for you." he swiped some mud with his tail and quickly smeared it over Zoldiav's slit.

Zoldiav shivered, not because he liked his slit being touched by someone else. But because he now had mud all over his slit "ughh... That's. That's so gross..." Nalvados, missing no occasion to mock Zoldiav, chuckled. He found Zoldiav's reaction funny. Zoldiav immediately turned his snout to face Nalvados who was mocking him "Something's funny??" from the tone of his voice Zoldiav clearly sounded annoyed.

"Yeah, you're ridiculous!" Nalvados and Zoldiav both started growling at each other.

Before they started fighting again Elrodin intervened "Stop! Now that we have our scent masked we better get going. Let's go somewhere far away from here so we can talk about what we've discovered about our enemy." Elrodin started walking away from their cave and away from where they knew their enemy was located at and the other two dragons followed his lead. "You two, make sure no one is following us." Elrodin ordered to Zoldiav and Nalvados. So, they both obeyed and looked around while walking to make sure no one was following them. They also made sure to cover their tracks, which slowed them down a little, but it was necessary. They walked like this for a while, until they decided they were far away enough from the cave they were at and so they started flying further away. Their flight was cold, no one spoke a word. Elrodin was in the front while Zoldiav and Nalvados were flying side by side. Which gave them the perfect opportunity for the two of them to growl at each other. Although not for long as Elrodin could hear them and turned his head back to stare at them both. And this happened more than once during their flight. After flying for half an hour they could see a lake in the distance. 'I can see a lake. That is perfect. We should be far away enough now, risks of coming across an enemy should be low now.' Elrodin thought to himself and he turned his head around to face the other two dragons. "Let's go to that lake. There we can talk freely while getting ourselves cleaned up." He saw them both nod at the same time and he chuckled "It's rare to see you two overgrown hatclhings agree on something."

"Tsk.. Don't get used to it. I just can't wait to get this disgusting mud off my slit." With that said, Zoldiav picked up the pace and went past Elrodin towards the lake. Nalvados couldn't let that pass. He won't let his rival get ahead of him so he did just the same and flew as fast as he could. Before long he got ahead of Zoldiav. Before Nalvados was out of his reach, Zoldiav reached out to his tail and bit down on it hard enough that Nalvados roared out in pain. Zoldiav, flying at high speed, avoided a collision with Nalvados who had stopped flying for a second.

"Damn that bastard!" Before he knew it, Zoldiav had already dived into the lake and won their implicit competition.

Meanwhile Elrodin who had stayed aback as he did not join their little race, just maintaining his speed, was watching them. "Yep... These two really are overgrown hatchlings." He said with a chuckle.

Zoldiav, who was now in the lake emerged from under the water and started cleaning himself. By now the mud had dried up so he had to rub it off his body. Not that he minded. He immediately started scrubbing his slit using his tail.

Not long after, however, Nalvados dived into the water next to Zoldiav and bit down on his tail just as hard as he previously did, dragging him back under water. Pissed off from getting interrupted when he was enjoying rubbing his slit, flailed his tail around to get it free from Nalvados' maw. The moment Nalvados let his tail go, his snout met one of Zoldiav's hind paw, kicking him. After receiving that kick Nalvados back off a bit, but not without getting himself ready to swim forth to bite Zoldiav, just waiting for the right moment. While Zoldiav turned around to face his opponent, Nalvados swam forward fast enough he took Zoldiav by surprise and couldn't get himself ready to dodge or block his attack.

However, just when he thought he was gonna get bit, Nalvados was no longer moving. "Did my bite excite you that much?~" Nalvados said while chuckling and pointing to Zoldiav's lower part of his body. Zoldiav, confused by Nalvados' behavior looked between his legs. His member was sticking out, not fully erect, but very well visible.

It wasn't uncommon for feral dragons to see other dragons' private parts. They often watched others having sex, some even casually have sex in front of everyone without a care in the world. However, Zoldiav felt very embarrassed, he didn't just get hard in front of his rival, he was hard in the middle of a fight. Flustered by this sudden turn of event Zoldiav swam back up and emerged, followed by Nalvados. "D-don't be such a fool! As if a nuisance like you could get me hard! I was rubbing my slit before you attacked me!"

Zoldiav and Nalvados were so focused on their little fight that they did not even notice Elrodin was here watching them. And was now right behind Zoldiav. "We all know you enjoy it when someone bites you~"

Zoldiav, completely unaware someone was behind him, startled and swam aside while turning around to face Elrodin. "Fuck! You scared me!"

"It doesn't take much to scare you~" Nalvados said mockingly. Zoldiav growled at Nalvados, whom returned the growls.

"Quit it you two! Play time's over. Let's get back to our business. What have you seen while spying in enemy territory?"

"I didn't see anything useful. The anthros were just training, shooting arrows, close combat with swords, running. Nothing out of ordinary." Nalvados said.

"Hmm... That's peculiar" Elrodin seemed a bit surprised, as if he was expecting something different. "And what about you, Zoldiav?"

"I saw anthros riding dragons. Some mages were making targets float in the air while anthros were training to shoot them with arrows and spells, all the while they were flying on dragons. Some targets were even made to move in the air."

While growling, Nalvados reacted "Those damned dragons. They're no better than pets or even slaves. I can't believe they're letting those filthy anthros ride them!" he was seemingly upset by that prospect.

"Calm down, Nalvados. They've been doing worse and you know it." Nalvados calmed down but was still emitting a low growl. "As for me. I saw a sorcerer that was capable of killing an adult, scaled dragon with his magic." Nalvados and Zoldiav both looked at Elrodin in shock.

'Wha-what?... An anthro killed a scaled dragon without the help of a dragon??' Nalvados was thinking while processing this information.

Meanwhile, Zoldiav couldn't believe what he heard. He tried to find an explanation instead. "That's impossible! Their magic is way too weak to kill a scaled dragon! Are you sure the dragon didn't have a hide??"

"Enough! I know what I saw! And as hard as it is to believe it's the plain truth. Now let me finish." They both listened Elrodin attentively. "That sorcerer, whoever they may be, demonstrated his prowess in public, in front of many anthros." Nalvados and Zoldiav couldn't believe their ears, they growled with anger. "That dragon did not even try to use magic. I don't know if he simply never had the ability to use magic. But as you well know, dragons who can't use magic are very rare. So I can't help but wonder if they might have incapacitated him somehow. Maybe they have learned of a spell or something that can render us unable to use magic."

"Either way... Anthros are learning powerful magic. If they can kill us with their magic and are also learning to ride dragons, they will become powerful foes. Up until now only dragons were a threat. But this..." Zoldiav started growling even more "This changes everything..." Getting angry, Nalvados swims his way to the shore. "Hey, where are you going?"

Nalvados stared back at Zoldiav "I'm going back there, and I'm going to kill them all!" he looked absolutely furious, and the tone of his voice sounded the part too.

"No, you can't go back there! You'll die if you go back! Zoldiav, help me stop him!" Zoldiav nodded and they both swam after Nalvados, who was now out of the water. He expanded his wings and flapped hiw wings to take off. But before he could do so, Nalvados used his magic to prevent him from taking off. While Nalvados flapped harder, struggling as he tried to take off, Zoldiav used this opportunity to get out of the water and before Nalvados realized, Zoldiav jumped onto him and pinned him down, pressing his back against the ground.

Nalvados struggled underneath him, trying to get him off of him. When he realized his efforts were in vain he tried persuasion instead. "Stop! Get off of me! We should kill all the anthros! They deserve to die! Why are you stopping me instead of killing all the anthros that made us suffer?!"

"Do you think I don't want to kill them just as much as you do?? But we can't go and attack them blindly otherwise we will be the one who get killed instead!" With renewed strength fueled by his anger, Nalvados struggled harder and he was about to push Zoldiav off of him. Seeing that he is about to break free, Zoldiav quickly bites at his neck hard and that got a loud roar out of him.

Only a split second later, Elrodin stepped next to them "Enough! Stop fighting each other like a couple of hatchlings!" They both suddenly stopped, Zoldiav letting go of his neck. "Save it for our enemy. We WILL attack them. But we can't do it now. We have to report back to the others and we certainly can't kill everyone with just the three of us. Is that understood!?" Nalvados looked up at Elrodin, and after a few seconds he nodded. Zoldiav then stepped off of him. "Good. We will go back to the group. It's a long way from here and night is about to fall. We will sleep here and we'll go at sunlight."

Nalvados stood up and stared at Zoldiav "That's the third time you bit me today, twice on my neck.."

Zoldiav turned his head around to Nalvados "Huh?" When he suddenly jumped at Zoldiav and pinned him down. Zoldiav was now growling at Nalvados "And here you are, giving me a reason to make it four!"

Nalvados playfully bapped his snout with a small chuckle "I knew you liked receiving bites, but I didn't know you liked giving them~"

Zoldiav kept growling "Don't act so tough you tail raiser!"

Meanwhile Elrodin sighed "A minute ago he was about to go on a rampage and now he's behaving like a hatchling... Okay, little ones. We'd better find a cave to sleep in for the night."

"Hear that little boy? Get off me." With a shove of his front paws Zoldiav pushed him off of him.

"Pfft. You're lucky we're still in enemy territory." Nalvados turned around and swayed his tail at Zoldiav in defiance.

"Enough you two! Let's look for a cave. There is a range of mountains north from here, there's probably a cave there. Let's go." Elrodin expanded his wings and flapped a few times before taking off.

"I hope it will be bigger than the one we stayed in during our mission. I don't want to sleep with Zoldiav literally next to me again" After his little remark Nalvados expanded his wings.

Before Nalvados took off, Zoldiav added "The feeling is mutual, you cling to me when you sleep." With that said Nalvados took off in the air and Zoldiav did the same a second after. The three dragons were now flying to the north, towards a mountain range in the hope of finding a cave to sleep in for the night. "So Elrodin, what do you think will happen when we tell the others from the group about everything we've seen at the enemy's training camps?"

"Hmmm... I'm not sure actually. With the anthros now capable to kill any one of us on their own and without much trouble, I doubt we will attack them head on."

"But it was only one of them!"

"I saw only one of them. That doesn't mean there isn't more. Who knows how many are that powerful, and how many more would be by the time we would attack them."

Zoldiav growled in frustration.

"There, I can see the mountains!"

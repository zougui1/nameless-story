The three dragons leave their cave, slowly att first as they made sure no one followed them and no one could track them. Then eventually they fly away until they're far away enough from where there cave was. They then share what they've seen before deciding to go back to their group to share their discoveries with them.
the discoveries they've made by spying:
- Nalvados: he didn't see anything useful. The anthros were just training shooting arrows. nothing out of oridnary.
- Zoldiav: he saw anthros riding dragons
- Elrodin: he saw a sorcerer that was capable to kill a scaled, adult dragon dragon with his magic and demonstrated it in front of many anthros. the dragon was utterly powerless against that sorcerer. However something else picked his attention. That dragon did not even try to use his magic. Most dragons were capable of using magic, those who couldn't were very rare. was this dragon never able to use magic, or were they incapacitated? Did that sorcerer suppress the dragon's magic?
  - Zoldiav reacts: regardless, anthros are learning powerful magic and they are learning to ride dragons. They may soon become powerful foes.

Getting angry, Nalvados tries to go back to where they came from but gets stopped by Zoldiav and Elrodin because it is too dangerous.
Elrodin suggests they go back to their group to report what they've learned. Nalvados, while unhappy with this, agrees.
On their way back to their territory, where their group is, they stumble upon a group of unknown people.(either anthros or dragons (either pacifists or supremacists. or *maybe* neutrals, but unlikely)).

The leader of the three dragons' group can read others' mind by placing a paw on their head. He can also transmit what he sees to those who are close to him.

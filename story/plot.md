Getting angry, Nalvados tries to go back to where they came from but gets stopped by Zoldiav and Elrodin because it is too dangerous.
Elrodin suggests they go back to their group to report what they've learned. Nalvados, while unhappy with this, agrees.
On their way back to their territory, where their group is, they stumble upon a group of unknown people.(either anthros or dragons (either pacifists or supremacists. or *maybe* neutrals, but unlikely)).

The leader of the three dragons' group can read others' mind by placing a paw on their head. He can also transmit what he sees to those who are close to him.

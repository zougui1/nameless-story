# General plot

## Chapter 1

Make their way back to the group drag on. So the three dragons are focused more so the readers can get invested in them.

Maybe a sex scene with the three dragons. Where Elrodin fucks them both, one after the other.

The chapter will end when the team has made it back to their group and have told them everything they've learned on the enemy.

## Chapter 2

At some point, while going somewhere they stumble upon some people.
Options:
  - 2 neutral dragons (Kuyzrin and Azrudin) whom are old friends of one of the team members. Sex will ensue
  - Anthros. The team will go attack them
  - Anthros along with a few enslaved dragons. The team will go and rescue the enslaved dragons. Result options:
    - The enslaved dragons will be grateful to the team and follow them for a part of the way. Maybe sex will ensue.
    - It turns out to be a trap and the "enslaved" dragons were in fact pacifists. A fight will ensue.

## Notes

The leader of the three dragons' group can read others' mind by placing a paw on their head. He can also transmit what he sees to those who are close to him.

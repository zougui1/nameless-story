### Feral Dragons

(NSFW)
Dragons don't care about privacy. They may or may not go somewhere "private" to have sex but they don't care if anyone hears or is watching them.

#### Clans

There are 3 clans of dragons. None of these clans are anything "official". They're all implicit.
Anyone who is against anthros is said to be a supremacist.
Anyone who is with anthros is said to be a pacifist.
Anyone who doesn't care is said to be neutral.
Dragons, no matter the clan, may live alone just like they may live in groups.

##### Pacifists

They are dragons who want to coexist with anthros.

##### Supremacists

They are dragons who don't want to coexist with dragons. They may have different reasons. Some may wish to exterminate anthros, enslave them, they just think they are far superior and anthros don't deserve to lay their eyes upon them, etc...

##### Neutrals

They just want to live their life. They don't care about anthros, pacifists or supremacists.

### Anthros

Anthros can be of any species. However, anthro dragons are rare as they are hybrids between feral dragons and anthros of whatever species.

(NSFW)
Anthros value privacy during intimate moments. They generally don't want anyone to see or hear them having sex (excluding kinks).

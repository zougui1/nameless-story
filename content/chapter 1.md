Zoldiav had just finished working for the day and retired to a cave. He usually lived with a group of dragons. But not today. Today he lived with only one other dragon, Nalvados. Whom he could already see in the cave as he approached. And that got him angry... 'How could he be so careless as to stay at the entrance of the cave?? Anyone who might be around could see him!' he thought to himself. When he arrived at the cave he greeted his rival with a tackle. Nalvados, caught by surprised, did not have time to react and he fell over. Zoldiav used that opportunity to wrap his tail around Nalvados' neck, loosely enough that he won't choke, and dragged him further into the cave.
"Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?!" Nalvados shouted accompanied with a roar as he struggled trying to get free but Zoldiav tightened his grip on his neck. "Shut up! If there is an enemy around they will know we're here! And you were staying at the entrance of the cave? You better hope no one saw you!"

As they were deep enough in the cave, where no one could see them, he released Nalvados' neck. Nalvados immediately got up onto all fours and gave Zoldiav a threatening stare while snarling. "That does not give you the right to tackle me and coil your tail around my neck, you could have choked me!" He was ready to attack, just waiting, gauging the dragon in front of him. "Oh yeah? Because maybe you have the right to get us all killed by staying at the entrance of the cave? Because if an enemy saw you we will be in trouble!"

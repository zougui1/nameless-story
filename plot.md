When Zoldiav and Nalvados are fighting, Elrodin steps into the cave and yells at them botg, reminding them that they're a team sent on a mission in ENEMY territory to gather information and that by making so much noise they're risking being discovered and thus jeopardizing their mission. The two of them, fearing a bit the power of their partner, immediately stop fighting. Then they talk about what they've learned:
- Nalvados: he didn't see or learn anything useful. The anthros were just training shooting arrows, nothing out of ordinary.
- Zoldiav: he saw the pacifists teaching magic to anthros.
  - Nalvados, afraid of the worse situation that could happen from that, asks what kind of magic the pacifists are teaching them. Zoldiav answers with just regular spells (no summoning spells)
- Elrodin: Reacting to what Zoldiav previously said, affirms that it's bad as he saw anthros training to shoot arrows while riding dragons.
  - Zoldiav then reacts by saying that it is indeed bad, if they learn powerful spells and if they also ride dragons they will become powerful foes

Getting angry, Nalvados walks towards the exit of the cave but gets stopped by Zoldiav and Elrodin because it is too dangerous.
